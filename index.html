                <p>My journey has been a wild dance from Northern California to the vibrant pulse of Los Angeles, where I discovered that dance isn’t just about movement—it’s about healing, growth, and transformation.</p>
                <p>With nearly a decade of project management experience, I’ve decided to mix things up and dive headfirst into the world of dance therapy. Dance isn’t just something I do—it’s the way I connect, inspire, and help others find their true rhythm. My passion lies in creating spaces where people can shed their fears, embrace their unique selves, and groove their way to confidence and emotional freedom.</p>
                <p>I’m all about using the power of dance to spark joy, build community, and fuel self-discovery. So, if you’re ready to move, shake, and transform, let’s get this dance party started!</p>
